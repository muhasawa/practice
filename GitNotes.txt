Push: To make changes made on local machine (Git) sync with remote (GitHub)
Pull: To download files on remote (GitHub) into local machine (Git)
Commit: To make changes permanent

1) git status <fileName>


Change in a file is known as MODIFIED (M)
New file is known as UNTRACKED (U)

So whenever a change in file/new file is added, you have to ADD.
When you ADD using 'git add <fileName>', the status becomes ADDED (A)
Once it's ADDED, our file status becomes STAGED
After STAGED, we COMMIT and status becomes (UNCHANGED)

2) git add <fileName>

    note: 'git add .' The dot means all files in the directory to be added

3) git commit -m "some message"
